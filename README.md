2️⃣ Install Dependencies:
- Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run this to install the app’s dependencies: npm install

**🔥 Quick Breakdown of Files:**

1️⃣ index.html:
- Contains the structure of your summarizer app, with two text areas for input and output.
- The magic happens when you click the Summarize button! 🪄

2️⃣ script.js:
- Handles the frontend logic.
- Verifies the length of text input (we’re not summarizing a tweet here – needs to be 200+ characters!).
- Sends the text to the backend API and gets the summarized text. 🎯

3️⃣ summarize.js:
- This is where the Hugging Face API call happens.
- It sends your text to Hugging Face and gets back a sweet summary.
- Uses Axios to make HTTP requests, and handles any errors that might come up. 🛠️

**💡 How It Works:**

- Paste your Text into the textarea.
- Click on Summarize.
- The app sends your text to the backend.
- The backend sends it to the Hugging Face API for summarization.
- You get your summarized text! 👏

Example: Here’s how it works in a nutshell:

Paste your super long text here

Paste your long essay...
And we’ll generate the summary for you, just like that!

🧑‍💻 API Call:
We’re making magic happen with Hugging Face's BART model! Here’s what the backend is sending to Hugging Face:

const data = JSON.stringify({
  "inputs": text,
  "parameters": { "max_length": 100, "min_length": 30 }
});
